# visualComparator
MATLAB-based program for visual and statistical comparison (two-sample tests) of high-dimensional data sets


visualComparator provides:
- visual comparison of ecdf's (empirical cumulative distribution functions) between two datasets
- location amd magnitude of the maximum deviation between ecdf's
- Kolomogorov-Smirnov test is used to compare the marginal distirbutions and extract the two-sample test p-value 
  (p-value >0.05 suggests possibility of the two datasets originating from the same underlying model)
- visual comparison of scatter plots and heat maps between two datasets
- display of Pearson, Kendall and Spearman correlation coefficients

See the wiki for more info.
